## My user stories
- As a player, I want to see the rules displayed so that I know how to play.
- As a player, I want several ways to win so that I can strategize.
- As a player, I want to know if I win or lose so that I get closure/know the game is over.

- As a signed-in user, I must be able to start a tic tac-toe game
- When playing as a user, I must start as X and rotate between X and O
- When playing as a user, I want to select available spaces on the board

## My planning, development story, problem-solving strategies
[informal planning outline](https://imgur.com/FHhiRQS)

- Outlining my plan was the first step for me in the development process. I referenced the project requirements and example tic-tac-toe games available on google searches to inform my outline. When confronted with problems, I read into the browser console's error messages (and browser network) to locate bugs in my code. This was in tandem with inserting console logs in my code where I suspected errors could be present. I also used curl scripts to rule out whether bugs were front-end or back-end related. 
- I tried three different strategies to create winning game logic, I ended up choosing to use a Winning Combos array to loop through and check for matches with player selections. 
- I am hoping to return to this project soon to include styles to match the coronavirus theme. 

## My unsolved mysteries
- I would love to include the option to play against a computer that has hidden defects, which would allow users to experience success. 
- I'd also like to include an option for users to select a character, such as hand sanitizer, lysol wipes, or a face mask. 

## My technologies/languages
jquery, json, bootstrap, sass css
